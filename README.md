# ReactGames
This repository is going to hold fun React games.

npm -i create-react-app
npx create-react-app card-match-up

npx is a tool intended to help round out the experience of using packages from the NPM registry â€” the same way npm makes it super easy to install and manage dependencies hosted on the registry, npx makes it easy to use CLI tools and other executables hosted on the registry.

cd card-match-up
npm start

npm install react-card-flip --save
ReactCardFlip allows us to use card flip animation. I find it easier to use rather than writing custom CSS animation for the card components.
